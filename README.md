## 🧠 Relevance for AI/ML Roles

These problems target skills critical for:
- Model optimization logic (DP, greedy, recursion)
- Stream-based data handling (sliding window, queue)
- Graph traversal & structure learning (used in GNNs, Airflow, decision trees)
- Time-series and sequence-aware processing
- ML system debugging (tree/graph integrity, path logic)
